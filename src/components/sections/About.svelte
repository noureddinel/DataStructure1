    <!-- About section text -->
    <Paragraph>The foundations of software development are data 
    structures and algorithms because they are crucial for developing a developer's 
    problem-solving skills. The course objective is to provide the fundamental 
    concepts of data structures and the principles of their implementation, and to 
    show how to implement them wisely in an algorithm, facilitating a seamless 
    transition to a high-level programming language.

    <Paragraph>
       This course introduces students to algorithmic thinking, programming concepts, 
       and problem-solving techniques using the C++ programming language. 
       Students will learn to design and implement simple algorithms, 
       work with data structures, and develop modular and efficient code. 
       The course includes lectures, tutorials, and lab sessions to provide a 
       comprehensive learning experience.

    <Paragraph>
        C++ is <a class="text-blue-600" href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank">TIOBE's</a> programming language of the year 2022. 
        It has won this title because C++ gained most popularity (+4.62%) in 2022. 
        The reason for C++'s popularity is its excellent performance while being a high 
        level object-oriented language. Because of this, it is possible to develop fast 
        and vast software systems (over millions of lines of code) in C++ without 
        necessarily ending up in a maintenance nightmare.
